Here\u0026rsquo;s how you deploy it to an AWS account with a starter secret under management.\nYou will need An AWS account. Don\u0026rsquo;t have one? Free tier is fine! Go get a free one at https://aws.amazon.com/free!\nAn Atlassian Bitbucket or a Github account, to host your Keydra configuration. We only support Bitbucket and Github right now, but expect to add other code repository providers in the future.\nInitial Deployment Setup a configuration repository Create a new private repository, clone it locally, and change to the new directory. See the relevant guide for your preferred platform option:\nGithub Gitlab Bitbucket Create a new directory called config, and initialise your environments and secrets files. We\u0026rsquo;ll start with one AWS environment (i.e. account) called main, and one sample secret called sample.\nmkdir config \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd config touch environments.yaml secrets.yaml Edit environments.yaml. This file tells Keydra about the AWS account it will deploy to, and which secrets to manage there. dev: description: Our Development AWS account type: aws access: dev id: \u0026lt;your AWS account ID\u0026gt; secrets: - sample For this example, we\u0026rsquo;ve told Keydra that this account is a dev one, but could also be production or uat. The sample line tells Keydra to manage that secret in this environment, which we\u0026rsquo;ll now define! You can add lots of environments (i.e. AWS accounts) to this file, just follow the same format and append.\nEdit secrets.yaml. This file tells Keydra about our secrets, just one for the time being - update with your repo organisation or user name, and update the provider key to match your code repo type. Note that the repository name here needs to be all lower case.\nWhat is the custodians key all about? This is just a free text value that can be used to indicate which person/team is the \u0026lsquo;owner\u0026rsquo; of this secret. Can be handy in a larger environment where secrets are not managed by one central team.\nsample: key: keydra_managed_sample description: A example secret which exists in IAM custodians: my_team provider: IAM rotate: nightly config: groups: - MyDeploymentGroup policies: - a/path/PolicyName distribute: - config: repository: keydraconfiguration account_username: \u0026lt;your repo org or user name\u0026gt; scope: repository envs: - dev key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID provider: \u0026lt;bitbucket OR github\u0026gt; source: key - config: repository: keydraconfiguration account_username: \u0026lt;your repo org or user name\u0026gt; scope: repository envs: - dev key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY provider: \u0026lt;bitbucket OR github\u0026gt; source: secret Now push your config up to the repo. git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git push origin main What have we setup? This secret will create/manage an IAM user, which we\u0026rsquo;ll rotate the password every night, and distribute the key and secret as two environment variables in our new code repository. Why would you do this? You could use these credentials in pipelines to deploy code to AWS. Rather than hardcoding these values in your repo, this way Keydra will ensure that they are:\nusing your least privilege deploy IAM group (MyDeploymentGroup, which we\u0026rsquo;ll create soon)\nare changed (very!) frequently to limit impact if compromised/exposed\nare not seen by sneaky humans that can put them onto sticky notes or sell on the dark web!\nDeploy Keydra to AWS On your local machine, clone the Keydra role and install dependencies. Always best to create/activate a Python virtualenv first, but will leave that up to you. git clone https://github.com/Athena-Home-Loans/keydra.git cd keydra pip install -r requirements-dev.txt pip install -r src/requirements.txt Friends don\u0026rsquo;t let friends use admin for everything!! Login to your AWS account console, and create a new IAM user called keydra_deploy, with programmatic access only and a policy like that in docs/KeydraDeploy.json.\nCreate an access key for the keydra_deploy user and stash the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as enviroment variables in your terminal.\nNow, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use AWS SAM \u0026lt;https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/\u0026gt;_ to deploy two CloudFormation stacks. The first one (keydraExecRole) sets up a least privilege role to run Keydra with. Execute the following on your local machine, changing the region to match your needs.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve added some additional restrictions to this sample role. This requires all Keydra managed secrets in AWS Secrets Manager to be tagged with \u0026ldquo;managedby: keydra\u0026rdquo;. If this annoys you, delete lines 52-54 to provide Keydra will perms to all secrets.\nsam build -t docs/KeydraExecRole.yaml sam deploy -t docs/KeydraExecRole.yaml --stack-name keydraExecRole --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --region ap-southeast-2 Assuming the SAM run was successful, you should see an outputs block with an Arn for the new role. Note this down, we\u0026rsquo;ll need this for step 7.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ll create the second stack, this one for keydra itself. Copy docs/sample_template.yaml to your main Keydra directory as template.yaml. This is a nice SAM template that will make this easy!\ncp docs/sample_template.yaml template.yaml Edit template.yaml. This looks daunting, but you only need to change the 6 values in angle brackets.\nIAM Role Arn - This is the ARN to an AWS IAM role that you\u0026rsquo;ll use to run Keydra, from step 5. repo account name - The code repo account or organisation name from the first section. secrets repo name - The repository name. In this example, this is KeydraConfiguration. path to secrets.yaml - The path to our secrets. For our example, this is src/main/config/secrets.yaml for Bitbucket, or main/config/secrets.yaml for Github. environments repo name - We\u0026rsquo;ll use the same repo, use KeydraConfiguration. path to environments.yaml - The path to our environments definition. For our example, this is src/main/config/environments.yaml for Bitbucket, or main/config/environments.yaml for Github. Build and deploy with SAM. Make sure Docker is installed/running first!\nsam build --use-container sam deploy --stack-name keydra --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND --region ap-southeast-2 Test Run Let\u0026rsquo;s do an adhoc trial run of the lambda!\nIn the AWS Console, navigate to the Lambda service.\nYou should see a keydra function, open it up.\nScroll down a little, and select the Test tab. Test with the following event, which tells Keydra to run a Nightly run with debug enabled. Click the Test button to run Keydra.\n{ \u0026#34;trigger\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nightly\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;debug\u0026#34;: true } With a little luck, you should see something like this! What just happened? Keydra created an IAM user in AWS, and then stored the IAM username and password in two separate repository variables in your code repository. You can see the results under your repo; browse to Repository settings \u0026gt; Repository variables in Bitbucket, or Settings \u0026gt; Secrets in Github. You can now use these values to deploy your code to AWS, and Keydra will kindly rotate them automagically every night, without you needing to do a thing!\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/keydra/getting_started/","title":"Getting_started","parent":"Keydra - Secrets Management for Humans!","content":""},{"id":6,"href":"/keydra/examples/githubactionsawsdeployment/","title":"Github Actions AWS Deployment Credentials","parent":"Examples","content":"Example to rotate an AWS IAM user password; then, using an access token from the AWS Secrets Manager secret located at keydra/github, encrypt the IAM user Id/password values and save them to secrets within the my_repo repo of the me Github account.\nsample: key: keydra_managed_sample description: A secret which exists in IAM custodians: my_team provider: IAM rotate: nightly distribute: - config: repository: my_repo account_username: me scope: repository envs: - dev key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID provider: github source: key - config: repository: my_repo account_username: me scope: repository envs: - dev key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY provider: github source: secret "},{"id":7,"href":"/keydra/examples/gitlabawsdeployment/","title":"Gitlab AWS Deployment Credentials","parent":"Examples","content":"Example to rotate an AWS IAM user\u0026rsquo;s AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY; then, using an access token from the AWS Secrets Manager secret located at keydra/gitlab, store the IAM user\u0026rsquo;s AK/SAK values as CI/CD variables within the group/infra/releases repo.\nsample: key: keydra_managed_sample description: A secret which exists in IAM custodians: my_team provider: IAM rotate: nightly distribute: - config: repository: group/infra/releases scope: repository envs: - \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID provider: gitlab source: key - config: repository: group/infra/releases scope: repository envs: - \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY provider: gitlab source: secret "},{"id":8,"href":"/keydra/examples/iamsplunk/","title":"IAM User to ingest AWS Logs into Splunk","parent":"Examples","content":"Example to rotate the secrets for an IAM user in AWS daily, creating if the user does not exist.

As in, set the following in your SAM template.yaml:\nVariables: KEYDRA_CFG_PROVIDER: gitlab KEYDRA_CFG_CONFIG_SECRETS_REPOSITORY: keydraconfiguration KEYDRA_CFG_CONFIG_SECRETS_REPOSITORYBRANCH: main KEYDRA_CFG_CONFIG_SECRETS_PATH: config/secrets.yaml KEYDRA_CFG_CONFIG_SECRETS_FILETYPE: yaml KEYDRA_CFG_CONFIG_ENVIRONMENTS_REPOSITORY: keydraconfiguration KEYDRA_CFG_CONFIG_ENVIRONMENTS_REPOSITORYBRANCH: main KEYDRA_CFG_CONFIG_ENVIRONMENTS_PATH: config/environments.yaml KEYDRA_CFG_CONFIG_ENVIRONMENTS_FILETYPE: yaml KEYDRA_CFG_CONFIG_ACCOUNTUSERNAME: notRequired Uses client Gitlab.\nQualys Provides password rotation support for Qualys accounts. Only rotate has been implemented, distribution is not (yet?) supported.\nFor a given secret specification, the rotate function fetches the contents of a AWS Secrets Manager secret located at keydra/qualys/\u0026lt;key\u0026gt; (using the key from the spec), and changes the password of the user specified on the Qualys platform. As Qualys does not permit a user to change their own password via API, the secret spec needs to specify a second account to be used to make the change.\nFor example, for a secret spec of:\nsample: description: API User key: api provider: qualys rotate: nightly config: rotatewith: key: keydra/qualys/backup provider: secretsmanager distribute: - key: keydra/qualys/api provider: secretsmanager source: secret envs: - prod The provider will take an AWS Secrets Manager secret, located at keydra/qualys/api:\n{ \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;US3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;apiuser\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ssh.Secret!\u0026#34; } Then use the creds of the secret at keydra/qualys/backup (in Secrets Manager, as configured in the spec) to connect to the Qualys API and change the password of the apiuser account. With the distribution setup in the example, the new password will then be placed into Secrets Manager, replacing the password with the new one.\nSee https://www.qualys.com/platform-identification/ to identify which platform your instance is on.\nUses client Qualys.\nSalesforce Salesforce (declared as salesforce): currently can only rotate secrets. Please note that users need to be manually created in salesforce before added here.\nSample secret spec:\nkey: salesforce_sample description: Salesforce Example custodians: your_team provider: salesforce rotate: nightly distribute: - key: keydra/salesforce/salesforce_sample provider: secretsmanager source: secret envs: - prod The Secrets Manager entry format is as follows:\n{ \u0026#34;provider\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;salesforce\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my_sf_user\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;secret\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my_sf_password\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sf_token\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;domain\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sf_domain\u0026#34; } The field names can be customised via a config section in the spec, e.g.:\nkey: salesforce_sample description: Salesforce Example provider: salesforce config: user_field: SF_USERNAME password_field: SF_PASSWORD token_field: SF_TOKEN domain_field: SF_DOMAIN # ... Uses client Salesforce.\nSalesforce Marketing Cloud Salesforce Marketing Cloud (declared as salesforce_marketing_cloud): currently can only rotate secrets. Please note that users need to be manually created in salesforce before added here, and be setup with the following roles:\nAdministration Users - Update (Allow) Email Admin API Access WebService API (Allow) XML API (Allow) Sample secret spec:\nsalesforce_marketing_cloud_user: key: sfuser-dev description: Secret for break glass access to Salesforce Dev custodians: sf_team provider: salesforce_marketing_cloud rotate: nightly distribute: - key: keydra/salesforce/sfmc-user provider: secretsmanager source: secret envs: - dev The Secrets Manager entry format is as follows:\n{ \u0026#34;provider\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;salesforce_marketing_cloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SF_USERNAME\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my_sf_user\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SF_PASSWORD\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my_sf_password\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sfmc_instance_mid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;businessUnit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sfmc_instance_bu_id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subdomain\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sfmc_subdomain\u0026#34;, } The field names can be customised via a config section in the spec, e.g.:\nkey: salesforce_marketing_cloud sample description: Salesforce Marketing Cloud Example provider: salesforce_marketing_cloud config: user_field: SF_USERNAME, password_field: SF_PASSWORD, subdomain_field: SF_SUBDOMAIN, businessUnit_field: SF_BUSINESUNIT, mid_field: SF_MID # ... Uses client Salesforce Marketing Cloud.\nSplunk Provides password (and token!) rotation and distribution support for Splunk. Rotation allows for Splunk account passwords/tokens to be rotated, while Distribute allows you to save passwords from other providers in Splunk apps, like Qualys or AWS.\nRotation can be done on only one Splunk instance at a time.\nWhen rotating passwords, a new 32 character password is generated (using AWS Secrets Manager) and the provider changes the Splunk password for the account corresponding to the \u0026ldquo;key\u0026rdquo; value in the secret. This change is made on the Splunk host defined within the \u0026ldquo;config\u0026rdquo; section of the secret.\nFor Splunk Tokens, the current token for that user is used to create a new token, and delete the old. No additional configuration is required - the provider auto detects the type of \u0026ldquo;password\u0026rdquo; being rotated, and acts accordingly.\nAn example secret spec to rotate a Splunk user password and store in AWS Secrets Manager:\nkey: splunkuser description: Splunk Rotation Example custodians: your_team provider: splunk rotate: nightly config: host: your.splunkhostname.com distribute: - key: keydra/splunk/splunkuser provider: secretsmanager source: secret envs: - prod The Secrets Manager entry format is as follows:\n{ \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;splunkuser\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890\u0026#34; } Distribution is a little more complex; configuring a Splunk App or Add-On with a service account to be used by that app to connect to various data sources. Only one destination host can be specified; if you need to send to more Splunk hosts you will need another distribution entry. The provider supports either Splunk storage passwords or a more custom method of actually storing the password on Splunk - which one to use depends on the destination Splunk TA/app. For example, the AWS app for Splunk uses the custom method, while the Qualys app uses storage passwords.\nThe destination app must already be installed on the Splunk instance, though the config entry / storage password will be created if it doesn’t already exist.\nKey Type Value key String The object to distribute to. Ignored/optional if we\u0026rsquo;re saving to a Splunk storage password. provider String Always “splunk” for this provider. provider_secret_key String The credentials that should be used to authenticate to the Splunk API. In the code, this value will be prepended with keydra/splunk/ to form the secret name in AWS Secrets Manager where the creds are stored. source Dict Used to pass through values from the secret being distributed - format is splunk field: secret key. In the example below, a field of \u0026ldquo;secret_key\u0026rdquo; will be used in the Splunk post, containing the value of the \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; key. config Dict See below for details. env List Which environments to run Keydra from. Should match the environment where the secret is held in Secrets Manager. In the config section:\nKey Type Value host String The Splunk host to configure. Only one destination host can be specified, if you need to distribute to more Splunk hosts you will need another distribution entry. app String Splunk App context to deploy to. appconfig Dict Used to add any values needed by this Add-On. All appconfig KV pairs will be passed to the Splunk call as is. path String Optional. Specifies the (case sensitive!) URL path to the configuration section to update. Omit this key to save to a splunk storage password instead. realm String Optional. If storage passwords are being used, the realm to use in the password. Defaults to blank. An example, to rotate an IAM user and distribute it into the AWS app/TA of a Splunk instance:\nkey: km_managed_splunk description: Rotate an AWS Splunk integration account custodians: your_team provider: IAM rotate: nightly distribute: - key: aws_security provider: splunk provider_secret_key: provisioning_user source: key_id: key secret_key: secret config: app: Splunk_TA_aws appconfig: category: 1 output_mode: json host: your.splunkhostname.com path: splunk_ta_aws_aws_account envs: - prod What does this do? Keydra will rotate these IAM credentials, then use the Splunk credentials stored in an AWS Secrets Manager secret, located at \u0026lsquo;keydra/splunk/provisioning_user\u0026rsquo; to connect to Splunk. It will then post the key value pairs in the config/appconfig section to the app specified (Splunk_TA_aws), mixing in the keys in the source section after mapping them from the secret. As in, the key value from the IAM secret will be posted as key_id.\nNote: The category 1 reference? This is the category of the account. \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; is AWS Global (not GovCloud).\nIf your app uses storage passwords (like the Qualys app), the distribution stanza would look more like:\n- provider: splunk provider_secret_key: provisioning_user source: name: username password: password config: app: TA-QualysCloudPlatform appconfig: output_mode: json host: your.splunkhostname.com envs: - prod Uses client Splunk.\nSplunk HEC Provides rotation support for Splunk Http Event Collector (HEC) tokens. Distribution is not supported by this provider.\nLike the Qualys provider, the spec requires you to specify a rotatewith value, which is where Keydra can find creds with which to access Splunk and make the change.\nBoth Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud are supported, but only the \u0026lsquo;Classic\u0026rsquo; experience for the latter. If using with Splunk Cloud, make sure the Splunk user you are rotating with has a role with the dmc_deploy_token_http and list_token_http capabilities.\nAn additional note on Splunk Cloud, which uses a DMC to distribute content to the indexes; rotating HEC tokens can take up to 5 minutes due to the cluster synchoronisation requirements.\nkey: hec1 description: Splunk HEC Rotation Example custodians: your_team provider: splunk_hec rotate: nightly config: host: your.splunkhostname.com rotatewith: key: keydra/splunk/admin provider: secretsmanager distribute: - key: keydra/splunk/hec1 provider: secretsmanager source: secret envs: - prod The Secrets Manager entry format is as follows:\n{ \u0026#34;hecInputName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;HEC Input Name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hecToken\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;13e58a8a-ab69-4c89-8941-51b26d797e5a\u0026#34; } Uses client Splunk.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/keydra/examples/salesforce/","title":"Salesforce Service Account","parent":"Examples","content":"Example to rotate the secrets for a Salesforce user daily, distributing the new password to Secrets Manager.\nsalesforce_user: key: sfuser-dev description: Secret for break glass access to Salesforce Prod custodians: sf_team provider: salesforce rotate: nightly distribute: - key: keydra/salesforce/sf-user provider: secretsmanager source: secret envs: - dev "},{"id":14,"href":"/keydra/developing/clients/","title":"Clients","parent":"Developing","content":"Clients commonly live in keydra.clients, but you may be sourcing it directly from somewhere else, or have other aspirations\u0026hellip; no judgement here.\nAnyway\u0026hellip; Clients are nothing but SDKs to facilitate (keep the code clean, really) the development of Providers.\nSee the provider documentation for more details on what\u0026rsquo;s supported.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/keydra/developing/contrib/","title":"Contribution Guidelines","parent":"Developing","content":"Plain and simple\u0026hellip; just cut a PR!\nBut not so fast!\nWork on a feature branch Make sure you have tests Did you drop coverage, be ready to discuss why Create a Pull Request.
