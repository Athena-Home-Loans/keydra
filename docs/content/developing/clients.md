*Clients* _commonly_ live in `keydra.clients`, but you may be sourcing it
directly from somewhere else, or have other aspirations... no judgement here.

Anyway... *Clients* are nothing but SDKs to facilitate (keep the code clean,
really) the development of *Providers*.

See the [client documentation](clients) for more details on what's supported.
