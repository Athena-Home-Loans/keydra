As of today they have 2 responsibilities:
rotation (which depending on the provider, can also be used to provision secrets)
distribution
&amp;hellip; and implement the methods described in keydra.providers.base. See the provider documentation for more details on what&amp;rsquo;s supported out of the box.
Rotation During the rotate phase, the provider will be invoked with a description (dict) of a secret.</description></item></channel></rss>
